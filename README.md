First Odin Project
I-m starting on The Odin Project as a way to be updated on Web Dev technologies and practise more to be able to get back for the carreer path that I study in all my school years. Life took me away for Game Dev for 6 years now, and I-m trying to recover all the knowledge that I previously had and work full time on my Web Dev passion!
